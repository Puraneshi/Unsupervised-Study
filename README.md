## Contents

- `palette.ipynb`: This notebook file demonstrates how to create a color palette using the K-means clustering algorithm and an input picture.

- `unsupervised-metrics.ipynb`: In this notebook file, alternative methods for finding the optimal number of clusters in unsupervised learning are explored, going beyond the classic elbow method.

- `image-metrics.ipynb`: Provides a step-by-step explanation of how to perform image segmentation and evaluate unsupervised clustering metrics.

## Color Palette Generation with K-means

The `palette.ipynb` notebook showcases an example of using the K-means clustering algorithm to create a color palette from an input picture. By applying clustering to the RGB values of the pixels in the image, the notebook generates a set of representative colors.

## Alternative Unsupervised Learning Metrics

In the `Unsupervised-metrics.ipynb` notebook, you will find various alternative methods for determining the optimal number of clusters in unsupervised learning. These methods go beyond the classical elbow method and explore alternative evaluation metrics and techniques.
